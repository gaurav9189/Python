# Python
This script is to check if your password has been pwned. The webiste haveibeenpwned exposes an API to check if the password used by any user been leaked and present in their database.
Rest assured that you don't have to reveal your password in order to check if there is leakage, which is where this gets interesting.
The API used for the project ensures to maintain k-anonymity which means- without revealing the password ourselves you could locally check the leaked password with the script itself.
